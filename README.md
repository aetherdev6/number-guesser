# Number Guesser
### A simple number guessing game writen in Python.
The rules are simple: select a desired interval, then guess the secret number the program selected!
#
This is my first public repository, and it's a small project im working on to improve my Python programming skills, so I'll try to constantly upgrade the code when I can!

### ENJOY ;)
